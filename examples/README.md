# Examples

## Adapter.ts

This file demonstrates how you would go about writing an adapter using
PrismatestJS. The example adapter uses CSS selectors to locate elements and uses
the Simulate React test utility to interact with them.

## Usage.test.tsx

This file demonstrates how you would use the adapter to construct test views
that let you inspect and interact with your application.

## Usage.tsx

This file doesn't demonstrate any elements of PrismatestJS, but it is a simple
app with a little interactivity that can be tested.
